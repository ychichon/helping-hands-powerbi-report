# Helping Hands – Power BI Engagement & Conversion Report

This project explores user engagement and conversion trends on a simulated grant-matching platform called **Helping Hands**. The goal was to identify which **non-partner organisations** are delivering the highest impact and should be prioritised for future partnerships, based on real user behaviour.

---

##  Project Overview

Helping Hands is a platform that connects individuals in need with financial support opportunities. These may include grants provided directly through the platform or via external (non-partner) organisations.

The project was designed to:

- Analyse user behaviour across grant searches and matches
- Identify bottlenecks and regional differences in engagement
- Recommend which external organisations should be invited as partners

---

##  Key Metrics & Features

- **Click-to-All-Matches Rate**: A measure of overall platform engagement
- **Conversion Rate (per grant and organisation)**: How often users select or match to a grant after viewing it
- **Breakdown by Organisation, Grant Type, Region**
- **Friction Point Analysis**: Detection of drop-off points in the user journey
- **Final Summary Page**: Business-friendly takeaways and recommendations
